## Welcome
We're @mark-et-cap - We're creating a browser extension that allows traders of stock and crypto to navigate directly from a ticker they've encountered on the web, directly to their preferred online stock brokerage, cryptocurrency exchange or research site. 

The extension works in the context of all webpages by highlighting the text of a stock or cryptocurrency ticker then right-clicking to open the context menu; certain sites have been optimized to allow users to simply right-click a URL rather than having to highlight - Twitter and Stocktwits are two examples of these types of 'smart' sites.

## Manifest V3

V2.8.0 of the extension accounts for the Manifest V3 (MV3) Upgrade as Manifest V2 (MV2) will be phased out in 2024. Fundamentally, there is no change in what the extension does; however, it did require a complete re-architecture which will be documented separately. 

If you're looking to use V2.8.0 you must install [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/) and the plugins [@rollup/plugin-node-resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-node-resolve) and [@rollup/plugin-commonjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-commonjs). Use the config file in our repository rollup.config.js and run "rollup -c" in cmd to generate the bundled background script.

## Where we're going

We'd love to gather feedback and build for real-life use cases. Let us know what you'd like to see, what you'd improve on and what's not working.

 ## Important note
  - commits containing references to v1.3 actually refer to v2.0.0 - after the commit it was determined that the changes go beyond a simple update and warrant a version change
